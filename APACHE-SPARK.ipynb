the riper should by time decease&#39;,\n &#39;His tender heir might bear his memory&#39;,\n &#39;But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes&#39;,\n &#39;Feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel&#39;,\n &#39;Making a famine where abundance lies&#39;,\n &#39;Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel&#39;,\n &#39;Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament&#39;,\n &#39;And only herald to the gaudy spring&#39;,\n &#39;Within thine own bud buriest thy content&#39;,\n &#39;And tender churl makst waste in niggarding&#39;,\n &#39;Pity the world or else this glutton be&#39;,\n &#39;To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;2&#39;,\n &#39;When forty winters shall besiege thy brow&#39;,\n &#39;And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field&#39;,\n &#39;Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now&#39;,\n &#39;Will be a tattered weed of small worth held&#39;,\n &#39;Then being asked where all thy beauty lies&#39;,\n &#39;Where all the treasure of thy lusty days&#39;,\n &#39;To say within thine own deep sunken eyes&#39;,\n &#39;Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise&#39;,\n &#39;How much more praise deserved thy beautys use&#39;,\n &#39;If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine&#39;,\n &#39;Shall sum my count and make my old excuse&#39;,\n &#39;Proving his beauty by succession thine&#39;,\n &#39;This were to be new made when thou art old&#39;,\n &#39;And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;3&#39;,\n &#39;Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest&#39;,\n &#39;Now is the time that face should form another&#39;,\n &#39;Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest&#39;,\n &#39;Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother&#39;,\n &#39;For where is she so fair whose uneared womb&#39;,\n &#39;Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry&#39;,\n &#39;Or who is he so fond will be the tomb&#39;,\n &#39;Of his selflove to stop posterity&#39;,\n &#39;Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee&#39;,\n &#39;Calls back the lovely April of her prime&#39;,\n &#39;So thou through windows of thine age shalt see&#39;,\n &#39;Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time&#39;,\n &#39;But if thou live remembered not to be&#39;,\n &#39;Die single and thine image dies with thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;4&#39;,\n &#39;Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend&#39;,\n &#39;Upon thy self thy beautys legacy&#39;,\n &#39;Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend&#39;,\n &#39;And being frank she lends to those are free&#39;,\n &#39;Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse&#39;,\n &#39;The bounteous largess given thee to give&#39;,\n &#39;Profitless usurer why dost thou use&#39;,\n &#39;So great a sum of sums yet canst not live&#39;,\n &#39;For having traffic with thy self alone&#39;,\n &#39;Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive&#39;,\n &#39;Then how when nature calls thee to be gone&#39;,\n &#39;What acceptable audit canst thou leave&#39;,\n &#39;Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee&#39;,\n &#39;Which used lives th executor to be&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;5&#39;,\n &#39;Those hours that with gentle work did frame&#39;,\n &#39;The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell&#39;,\n &#39;Will play the tyrants to the very same&#39;,\n &#39;And that unfair which fairly doth excel&#39;,\n &#39;For neverresting time leads summer on&#39;,\n &#39;To hideous winter and confounds him there&#39;,\n &#39;Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone&#39;,\n &#39;Beauty oersnowed and bareness every where&#39;,\n &#39;Then were not summers distillation left&#39;,\n &#39;A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass&#39;,\n &#39;Beautys effect with beauty were bereft&#39;,\n &#39;Nor it nor no remembrance what it was&#39;,\n &#39;But flowers distilled though they with winter meet&#39;,\n &#39;Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;6&#39;,\n &#39;Then let not winters ragged hand deface&#39;,\n &#39;In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled&#39;,\n &#39;Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place&#39;,\n &#39;With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled&#39;,\n &#39;That use is not forbidden usury&#39;,\n &#39;Which happies those that pay the willing loan&#39;,\n &#39;Thats for thy self to breed another thee&#39;,\n &#39;Or ten times happier be it ten for one&#39;,\n &#39;Ten times thy self were happier than thou art&#39;,\n &#39;If ten of thine ten times refigured thee&#39;,\n &#39;Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart&#39;,\n &#39;Leaving thee living in posterity&#39;,\n &#39;Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair&#39;,\n &#39;To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;7&#39;,\n &#39;Lo in the orient when the gracious light&#39;,\n &#39;Lifts up his burning head each under eye&#39;,\n &#39;Doth homage to his newappearing sight&#39;,\n &#39;Serving with looks his sacred majesty&#39;,\n &#39;And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill&#39;,\n &#39;Resembling strong youth in his middle age&#39;,\n &#39;Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still&#39;,\n &#39;Attending on his golden pilgrimage&#39;,\n &#39;But when from highmost pitch with weary car&#39;,\n &#39;Like feeble age he reeleth from the day&#39;,\n &#39;The eyes fore duteous now converted are&#39;,\n &#39;From his low tract and look another way&#39;,\n &#39;So thou thy self outgoing in thy noon&#39;,\n &#39;Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;8&#39;,\n &#39;Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly&#39;,\n &#39;Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy&#39;,\n &#39;Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly&#39;,\n &#39;Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy&#39;,\n &#39;If the true concord of welltuned sounds&#39;,\n &#39;By unions married do offend thine ear&#39;,\n &#39;They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds&#39;,\n &#39;In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear&#39;,\n &#39;Mark how one string sweet husband to another&#39;,\n &#39;Strikes each in each by mutual ordering&#39;,\n &#39;Resembling sire and child and happy mother&#39;,\n &#39;Who all in one one pleasing note do sing&#39;,\n &#39;Whose speechless song being many seeming one&#39;,\n &#39;Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;9&#39;,\n &#39;Is it for fear to wet a widows eye&#39;,\n &#39;That thou consumst thy self in single life&#39;,\n &#39;Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die&#39;,\n &#39;The world will wail thee like a makeless wife&#39;,\n &#39;The world will be thy widow and still weep&#39;,\n &#39;That thou no form of thee hast left behind&#39;,\n &#39;When every private widow well may keep&#39;,\n &#39;By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind&#39;,\n &#39;Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend&#39;,\n &#39;Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it&#39;,\n &#39;But beautys waste hath in the world an end&#39;,\n &#39;And kept unused the user so destroys it&#39;,\n &#39;No love toward others in that bosom sits&#39;,\n &#39;That on himself such murdrous shame commits&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;10&#39;,\n &#39;For shame deny that thou bearst love to any&#39;,\n &#39;Who for thy self art so unprovident&#39;,\n &#39;Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many&#39;,\n &#39;But that thou none lovst is most evident&#39;,\n &#39;For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate&#39;,\n &#39;That gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire&#39;,\n &#39;Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39;Which to repair should be thy chief desire&#39;,\n &#39;O change thy thought that I may change my mind&#39;,\n &#39;Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love&#39;,\n &#39;Be as thy presence is gracious and kind&#39;,\n &#39;Or to thy self at least kindhearted prove&#39;,\n &#39;Make thee another self for love of me&#39;,\n &#39;That beauty still may live in thine or thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;11&#39;,\n &#39;As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst&#39;,\n &#39;In one of thine from that which thou departest&#39;,\n &#39;And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst&#39;,\n &#39;Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest&#39;,\n &#39;Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase&#39;,\n &#39;Without this folly age and cold decay&#39;,\n &#39;If all were minded so the times should cease&#39;,\n &#39;And threescore year would make the world away&#39;,\n &#39;Let those whom nature hath not made for store&#39;,\n &#39;Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish&#39;,\n &#39;Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more&#39;,\n &#39;Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish&#39;,\n &#39;She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby&#39;,\n &#39;Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;12&#39;,\n &#39;When I do count the clock that tells the time&#39;,\n &#39;And see the brave day sunk in hideous night&#39;,\n &#39;When I behold the violet past prime&#39;,\n &#39;And sable curls all silvered oer with white&#39;,\n &#39;When lofty trees I see barren of leaves&#39;,\n &#39;Which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#39;And summers green all girded up in sheaves&#39;,\n &#39;Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard&#39;,\n &#39;Then of thy beauty do I question make&#39;,\n &#39;That thou among the wastes of time must go&#39;,\n &#39;Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake&#39;,\n &#39;And die as fast as they see others grow&#39;,\n &#39;And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence&#39;,\n &#39;Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;13&#39;,\n &#39;O that you were your self but love you are&#39;,\n &#39;No longer yours than you your self here live&#39;,\n &#39;Against this coming end you should prepare&#39;,\n &#39;And your sweet semblance to some other give&#39;,\n &#39;So should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39;Find no determination then you were&#39;,\n &#39;Your self again after your selfs decease&#39;,\n &#39;When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear&#39;,\n &#39;Who lets so fair a house fall to decay&#39;,\n &#39;Which husbandry in honour might uphold&#39;,\n &#39;Against the stormy gusts of winters day&#39;,\n &#39;And barren rage of deaths eternal cold&#39;,\n &#39;O none but unthrifts dear my love you know&#39;,\n &#39;You had a father let your son say so&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;14&#39;,\n &#39;Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck&#39;,\n &#39;And yet methinks I have astronomy&#39;,\n &#39;But not to tell of good or evil luck&#39;,\n &#39;Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality&#39;,\n &#39;Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell&#39;,\n &#39;Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind&#39;,\n &#39;Or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39;By oft predict that I in heaven find&#39;,\n &#39;But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive&#39;,\n &#39;And constant stars in them I read such art&#39;,\n &#39;As truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39;If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert&#39;,\n &#39;Or else of thee this I prognosticate&#39;,\n &#39;Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;15&#39;,\n &#39;When I consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39;Holds in perfection but a little moment&#39;,\n &#39;That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39;Whereon the stars in secret influence comment&#39;,\n &#39;When I perceive that men as plants increase&#39;,\n &#39;Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky&#39;,\n &#39;Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease&#39;,\n &#39;And wear their brave state out of memory&#39;,\n &#39;Then the conceit of this inconstant stay&#39;,\n &#39;Sets you most rich in youth before my sight&#39;,\n &#39;Where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39;To change your day of youth to sullied night&#39;,\n &#39;And all in war with Time for love of you&#39;,\n &#39;As he takes from you I engraft you new&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;16&#39;,\n &#39;But wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39;Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time&#39;,\n &#39;And fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39;With means more blessed than my barren rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;Now stand you on the top of happy hours&#39;,\n &#39;And many maiden gardens yet unset&#39;,\n &#39;With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers&#39;,\n &#39;Much liker than your painted counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39;So should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#39;Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen&#39;,\n &#39;Neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39;Can make you live your self in eyes of men&#39;,\n &#39;To give away your self keeps your self still&#39;,\n &#39;And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;17&#39;,\n &#39;Who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39;If it were filled with your most high deserts&#39;,\n &#39;Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39;Which hides your life and shows not half your parts&#39;,\n &#39;If I could write the beauty of your eyes&#39;,\n &#39;And in fresh numbers number all your graces&#39;,\n &#39;The age to come would say this poet lies&#39;,\n &#39;Such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces&#39;,\n &#39;So should my papers yellowed with their age&#39;,\n &#39;Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue&#39;,\n &#39;And your true rights be termed a poets rage&#39;,\n &#39;And stretched metre of an antique song&#39;,\n &#39;But were some child of yours alive that time&#39;,\n &#39;You should live twice in it and in my rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;18&#39;,\n &#39;Shall I compare thee to a summers day&#39;,\n &#39;Thou art more lovely and more temperate&#39;,\n &#39;Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May&#39;,\n &#39;And summers lease hath all too short a date&#39;,\n &#39;Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines&#39;,\n &#39;And often is his gold complexion dimmed&#39;,\n &#39;And every fair from fair sometime declines&#39;,\n &#39;By chance or natures changing course untrimmed&#39;,\n &#39;But thy eternal summer shall not fade&#39;,\n &#39;Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst&#39;,\n &#39;Nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade&#39;,\n &#39;When in eternal lines to time thou growst&#39;,\n &#39;So long as men can breathe or eyes can see&#39;,\n &#39;So long lives this and this gives life to thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;19&#39;,\n &#39;Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws&#39;,\n &#39;And make the earth devour her own sweet brood&#39;,\n &#39;Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws&#39;,\n &#39;And burn the longlived phoenix in her blood&#39;,\n &#39;Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst&#39;,\n &#39;And do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted Time&#39;,\n &#39;To the wide world and all her fading sweets&#39;,\n &#39;But I forbid thee one most heinous crime&#39;,\n &#39;O carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow&#39;,\n &#39;Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen&#39;,\n &#39;Him in thy course untainted do allow&#39;,\n &#39;For beautys pattern to succeeding men&#39;,\n &#39;Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong&#39;,\n &#39;My love shall in my verse ever live young&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;20&#39;,\n &#39;A womans face with natures own hand painted&#39;,\n &#39;Hast thou the master mistress of my passion&#39;,\n &#39;A womans gentle heart but not acquainted&#39;,\n &#39;With shifting change as is false womens fashion&#39;,\n &#39;An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling&#39;,\n &#39;Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth&#39;,\n &#39;A man in hue all hues in his controlling&#39;,\n &#39;Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth&#39;,\n &#39;And for a woman wert thou first created&#39;,\n &#39;Till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting&#39;,\n &#39;And by addition me of thee defeated&#39;,\n &#39;By adding one thing to my purpose nothing&#39;,\n &#39;But since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;21&#39;,\n &#39;So is it not with me as with that muse&#39;,\n &#39;Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse&#39;,\n &#39;Who heaven it self for ornament doth use&#39;,\n &#39;And every fair with his fair doth rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;Making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#39;With sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems&#39;,\n &#39;With Aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare&#39;,\n &#39;That heavens air in this huge rondure hems&#39;,\n &#39;O let me true in love but truly write&#39;,\n &#39;And then believe me my love is as fair&#39;,\n &#39;As any mothers child though not so bright&#39;,\n &#39;As those gold candles fixed in heavens air&#39;,\n &#39;Let them say more that like of hearsay well&#39;,\n &#39;I will not praise that purpose not to sell&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;22&#39;,\n &#39;My glass shall not persuade me I am old&#39;,\n &#39;So long as youth and thou are of one date&#39;,\n &#39;But when in thee times furrows I behold&#39;,\n &#39;Then look I death my days should expiate&#39;,\n &#39;For all that beauty that doth cover thee&#39;,\n &#39;Is but the seemly raiment of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me&#39;,\n &#39;How can I then be elder than thou art&#39;,\n &#39;O therefore love be of thyself so wary&#39;,\n &#39;As I not for my self but for thee will&#39;,\n &#39;Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39;As tender nurse her babe from faring ill&#39;,\n &#39;Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain&#39;,\n &#39;Thou gavst me thine not to give back again&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;23&#39;,\n &#39;As an unperfect actor on the stage&#39;,\n &#39;Who with his fear is put beside his part&#39;,\n &#39;Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage&#39;,\n &#39;Whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart&#39;,\n &#39;So I for fear of trust forget to say&#39;,\n &#39;The perfect ceremony of loves rite&#39;,\n &#39;And in mine own loves strength seem to decay&#39;,\n &#39;Oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might&#39;,\n &#39;O let my looks be then the eloquence&#39;,\n &#39;And dumb presagers of my speaking breast&#39;,\n &#39;Who plead for love and look for recompense&#39;,\n &#39;More than that tongue that more hath more expressed&#39;,\n &#39;O learn to read what silent love hath writ&#39;,\n &#39;To hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;24&#39;,\n &#39;Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled&#39;,\n &#39;Thy beautys form in table of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;My body is the frame wherein tis held&#39;,\n &#39;And perspective it is best painters art&#39;,\n &#39;For through the painter must you see his skill&#39;,\n &#39;To find where your true image pictured lies&#39;,\n &#39;Which in my bosoms shop is hanging still&#39;,\n &#39;That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes&#39;,\n &#39;Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done&#39;,\n &#39;Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39;Are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun&#39;,\n &#39;Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee&#39;,\n &#39;Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art&#39;,\n &#39;They draw but what they see know not the heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;25&#39;,\n &#39;Let those who are in favour with their stars&#39;,\n &#39;Of public honour and proud titles boast&#39;,\n &#39;Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39;Unlooked for joy in that I honour most&#39;,\n &#39;Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread&#39;,\n &#39;But as the marigold at the suns eye&#39;,\n &#39;And in themselves their pride lies buried&#39;,\n &#39;For at a frown they in their glory die&#39;,\n &#39;The painful warrior famoused for fight&#39;,\n &#39;After a thousand victories once foiled&#39;,\n &#39;Is from the book of honour razed quite&#39;,\n &#39;And all the rest forgot for which he toiled&#39;,\n &#39;Then happy I that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39;Where I may not remove nor be removed&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;26&#39;,\n &#39;Lord of my love to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39;Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit&#39;,\n &#39;To thee I send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39;To witness duty not to show my wit&#39;,\n &#39;Duty so great which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39;May make seem bare in wanting words to show it&#39;,\n &#39;But that I hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#39;In thy souls thought all naked will bestow it&#39;,\n &#39;Till whatsoever star that guides my moving&#39;,\n &#39;Points on me graciously with fair aspect&#39;,\n &#39;And puts apparel on my tattered loving&#39;,\n &#39;To show me worthy of thy sweet respect&#39;,\n &#39;Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee&#39;,\n &#39;Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;27&#39;,\n &#39;Weary with toil I haste me to my bed&#39;,\n &#39;The dear respose for limbs with travel tired&#39;,\n &#39;But then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#39;To work my mind when bodys works expired&#39;,\n &#39;For then my thoughts from far where I abide&#39;,\n &#39;Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee&#39;,\n &#39;And keep my drooping eyelids open wide&#39;,\n &#39;Looking on darkness which the blind do see&#39;,\n &#39;Save that my souls imaginary sight&#39;,\n &#39;Presents thy shadow to my sightless view&#39;,\n &#39;Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night&#39;,\n &#39;Makes black night beauteous and her old face new&#39;,\n &#39;Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind&#39;,\n &#39;For thee and for my self no quiet find&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;28&#39;,\n &#39;How can I then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39;That am debarred the benefit of rest&#39;,\n &#39;When days oppression is not eased by night&#39;,\n &#39;But day by night and night by day oppressed&#39;,\n &#39;And each though enemies to eithers reign&#39;,\n &#39;Do in consent shake hands to torture me&#39;,\n &#39;The one by toil the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39;How far I toil still farther off from thee&#39;,\n &#39;I tell the day to please him thou art bright&#39;,\n &#39;And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven&#39;,\n &#39;So flatter I the swartcomplexioned night&#39;,\n &#39;When sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even&#39;,\n &#39;But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer&#39;,\n &#39;And night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;29&#39;,\n &#39;When in disgrace with Fortune and mens eyes&#39;,\n &#39;I all alone beweep my outcast state&#39;,\n &#39;And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries&#39;,\n &#39;And look upon my self and curse my fate&#39;,\n &#39;Wishing me like to one more rich in hope&#39;,\n &#39;Featured like him like him with friends possessed&#39;,\n &#39;Desiring this mans art and that mans scope&#39;,\n &#39;With what I most enjoy contented least&#39;,\n &#39;Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising&#39;,\n &#39;Haply I think on thee and then my state&#39;,\n &#39;Like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#39;From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate&#39;,\n &#39;For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings&#39;,\n &#39;That then I scorn to change my state with kings&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;30&#39;,\n &#39;When to the sessions of sweet silent thought&#39;,\n &#39;I summon up remembrance of things past&#39;,\n &#39;I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought&#39;,\n &#39;And with old woes new wail my dear times waste&#39;,\n &#39;Then can I drown an eye unused to flow&#39;,\n &#39;For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night&#39;,\n &#39;And weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe&#39;,\n &#39;And moan th expense of many a vanished sight&#39;,\n &#39;Then can I grieve at grievances foregone&#39;,\n &#39;And heavily from woe to woe tell oer&#39;,\n &#39;The sad account of forebemoaned moan&#39;,\n &#39;Which I new pay as if not paid before&#39;,\n &#39;But if the while I think on thee dear friend&#39;,\n &#39;All losses are restored and sorrows end&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;31&#39;,\n &#39;Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts&#39;,\n &#39;Which I by lacking have supposed dead&#39;,\n &#39;And there reigns love and all loves loving parts&#39;,\n &#39;And all those friends which I thought buried&#39;,\n &#39;How many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#39;Hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye&#39;,\n &#39;As interest of the dead which now appear&#39;,\n &#39;But things removed that hidden in thee lie&#39;,\n &#39;Thou art the grave where buried love doth live&#39;,\n &#39;Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone&#39;,\n &#39;Who all their parts of me to thee did give&#39;,\n &#39;That due of many now is thine alone&#39;,\n &#39;Their images I loved I view in thee&#39;,\n &#39;And thou all they hast all the all of me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;32&#39;,\n &#39;If thou survive my wellcontented day&#39;,\n &#39;When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39;And shalt by fortune once more resurvey&#39;,\n &#39;These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover&#39;,\n &#39;Compare them with the bettring of the time&#39;,\n &#39;And though they be outstripped by every pen&#39;,\n &#39;Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;Exceeded by the height of happier men&#39;,\n &#39;O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought&#39;,\n &#39;Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age&#39;,\n &#39;A dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39;To march in ranks of better equipage&#39;,\n &#39;But since he died and poets better prove&#39;,\n &#39;Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;33&#39;,\n &#39;Full many a glorious morning have I seen&#39;,\n &#39;Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye&#39;,\n &#39;Kissing with golden face the meadows green&#39;,\n &#39;Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy&#39;,\n &#39;Anon permit the basest clouds to ride&#39;,\n &#39;With ugly rack on his celestial face&#39;,\n &#39;And from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39;Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;Even so my sun one early morn did shine&#39;,\n &#39;With all triumphant splendour on my brow&#39;,\n &#39;But out alack he was but one hour mine&#39;,\n &#39;The region cloud hath masked him from me now&#39;,\n &#39;Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth&#39;,\n &#39;Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;34&#39;,\n &#39;Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day&#39;,\n &#39;And make me travel forth without my cloak&#39;,\n &#39;To let base clouds oertake me in my way&#39;,\n &#39;Hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke&#39;,\n &#39;Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break&#39;,\n &#39;To dry the rain on my stormbeaten face&#39;,\n &#39;For no man well of such a salve can speak&#39;,\n &#39;That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief&#39;,\n &#39;Though thou repent yet I have still the loss&#39;,\n &#39;Th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief&#39;,\n &#39;To him that bears the strong offences cross&#39;,\n &#39;Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds&#39;,\n &#39;And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;35&#39;,\n &#39;No more be grieved at that which thou hast done&#39;,\n &#39;Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud&#39;,\n &#39;Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun&#39;,\n &#39;And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud&#39;,\n &#39;All men make faults and even I in this&#39;,\n &#39;Authorizing thy trespass with compare&#39;,\n &#39;My self corrupting salving thy amiss&#39;,\n &#39;Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are&#39;,\n &#39;For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense&#39;,\n &#39;Thy adverse party is thy advocate&#39;,\n &#39;And gainst my self a lawful plea commence&#39;,\n &#39;Such civil war is in my love and hate&#39;,\n &#39;That I an accessary needs must be&#39;,\n &#39;To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;36&#39;,\n &#39;Let me confess that we two must be twain&#39;,\n &#39;Although our undivided loves are one&#39;,\n &#39;So shall those blots that do with me remain&#39;,\n &#39;Without thy help by me be borne alone&#39;,\n &#39;In our two loves there is but one respect&#39;,\n &#39;Though in our lives a separable spite&#39;,\n &#39;Which though it alter not loves sole effect&#39;,\n &#39;Yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight&#39;,\n &#39;I may not evermore acknowledge thee&#39;,\n &#39;Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame&#39;,\n &#39;Nor thou with public kindness honour me&#39;,\n &#39;Unless thou take that honour from thy name&#39;,\n &#39;But do not so I love thee in such sort&#39;,\n &#39;As thou being mine mine is thy good report&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;37&#39;,\n &#39;As a decrepit father takes delight&#39;,\n &#39;To see his active child do deeds of youth&#39;,\n &#39;So I made lame by Fortunes dearest spite&#39;,\n &#39;Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth&#39;,\n &#39;For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit&#39;,\n &#39;Or any of these all or all or more&#39;,\n &#39;Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit&#39;,\n &#39;I make my love engrafted to this store&#39;,\n &#39;So then I am not lame poor nor despised&#39;,\n &#39;Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give&#39;,\n &#39;That I in thy abundance am sufficed&#39;,\n &#39;And by a part of all thy glory live&#39;,\n &#39;Look what is best that best I wish in thee&#39;,\n &#39;This wish I have then ten times happy me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;38&#39;,\n &#39;How can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#39;While thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse&#39;,\n &#39;Thine own sweet argument too excellent&#39;,\n &#39;For every vulgar paper to rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;O give thy self the thanks if aught in me&#39;,\n &#39;Worthy perusal stand against thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;For whos so dumb that cannot write to thee&#39;,\n &#39;When thou thy self dost give invention light&#39;,\n &#39;Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39;Than those old nine which rhymers invocate&#39;,\n &#39;And he that calls on thee let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39;Eternal numbers to outlive long date&#39;,\n &#39;If my slight muse do please these curious days&#39;,\n &#39;The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;39&#39;,\n &#39;O how thy worth with manners may I sing&#39;,\n &#39;When thou art all the better part of me&#39;,\n &#39;What can mine own praise to mine own self bring&#39;,\n &#39;And what ist but mine own when I praise thee&#39;,\n &#39;Even for this let us divided live&#39;,\n &#39;And our dear love lose name of single one&#39;,\n &#39;That by this separation I may give&#39;,\n &#39;That due to thee which thou deservst alone&#39;,\n &#39;O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove&#39;,\n &#39;Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave&#39;,\n &#39;To entertain the time with thoughts of love&#39;,\n &#39;Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive&#39;,\n &#39;And that thou teachest how to make one twain&#39;,\n &#39;By praising him here who doth hence remain&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;40&#39;,\n &#39;Take all my loves my love yea take them all&#39;,\n &#39;What hast thou then more than thou hadst before&#39;,\n &#39;No love my love that thou mayst true love call&#39;,\n &#39;All mine was thine before thou hadst this more&#39;,\n &#39;Then if for my love thou my love receivest&#39;,\n &#39;I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest&#39;,\n &#39;But yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39;By wilful taste of what thy self refusest&#39;,\n &#39;I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39;Although thou steal thee all my poverty&#39;,\n &#39;And yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#39;To bear greater wrong than hates known injury&#39;,\n &#39;Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows&#39;,\n &#39;Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;41&#39;,\n &#39;Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits&#39;,\n &#39;When I am sometime absent from thy heart&#39;,\n &#39;Thy beauty and thy years full well befits&#39;,\n &#39;For still temptation follows where thou art&#39;,\n &#39;Gentle thou art and therefore to be won&#39;,\n &#39;Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed&#39;,\n &#39;And when a woman woos what womans son&#39;,\n &#39;Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed&#39;,\n &#39;Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear&#39;,\n &#39;And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth&#39;,\n &#39;Who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39;Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth&#39;,\n &#39;Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee&#39;,\n &#39;Thine by thy beauty being false to me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;42&#39;,\n &#39;That thou hast her it is not all my grief&#39;,\n &#39;And yet it may be said I loved her dearly&#39;,\n &#39;That she hath thee is of my wailing chief&#39;,\n &#39;A loss in love that touches me more nearly&#39;,\n &#39;Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye&#39;,\n &#39;Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her&#39;,\n &#39;And for my sake even so doth she abuse me&#39;,\n &#39;Suffring my friend for my sake to approve her&#39;,\n &#39;If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain&#39;,\n &#39;And losing her my friend hath found that loss&#39;,\n &#39;Both find each other and I lose both twain&#39;,\n &#39;And both for my sake lay on me this cross&#39;,\n &#39;But heres the joy my friend and I are one&#39;,\n &#39;Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;43&#39;,\n &#39;When most I wink then do mine eyes best see&#39;,\n &#39;For all the day they view things unrespected&#39;,\n &#39;But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee&#39;,\n &#39;And darkly bright are bright in dark directed&#39;,\n &#39;Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#39;How would thy shadows form form happy show&#39;,\n &#39;To the clear day with thy much clearer light&#39;,\n &#39;When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so&#39;,\n &#39;How would I say mine eyes be blessed made&#39;,\n &#39;By looking on thee in the living day&#39;,\n &#39;When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade&#39;,\n &#39;Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay&#39;,\n &#39;All days are nights to see till I see thee&#39;,\n &#39;And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;44&#39;,\n &#39;If the dull substance of my flesh were thought&#39;,\n &#39;Injurious distance should not stop my way&#39;,\n &#39;For then despite of space I would be brought&#39;,\n &#39;From limits far remote where thou dost stay&#39;,\n &#39;No matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39;Upon the farthest earth removed from thee&#39;,\n &#39;For nimble thought can jump both sea and land&#39;,\n &#39;As soon as think the place where he would be&#39;,\n &#39;But ah thought kills me that I am not thought&#39;,\n &#39;To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone&#39;,\n &#39;But that so much of earth and water wrought&#39;,\n &#39;I must attend times leisure with my moan&#39;,\n &#39;Receiving nought by elements so slow&#39;,\n &#39;But heavy tears badges of eithers woe&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;45&#39;,\n &#39;The other two slight air and purging fire&#39;,\n &#39;Are both with thee wherever I abide&#39;,\n &#39;The first my thought the other my desire&#39;,\n &#39;These presentabsent with swift motion slide&#39;,\n &#39;For when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39;In tender embassy of love to thee&#39;,\n &#39;My life being made of four with two alone&#39;,\n &#39;Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy&#39;,\n &#39;Until lifes composition be recured&#39;,\n &#39;By those swift messengers returned from thee&#39;,\n &#39;Who even but now come back again assured&#39;,\n &#39;Of thy fair health recounting it to me&#39;,\n &#39;This told I joy but then no longer glad&#39;,\n &#39;I send them back again and straight grow sad&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;46&#39;,\n &#39;Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war&#39;,\n &#39;How to divide the conquest of thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar&#39;,\n &#39;My heart mine eye the freedom of that right&#39;,\n &#39;My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie&#39;,\n &#39;A closet never pierced with crystal eyes&#39;,\n &#39;But the defendant doth that plea deny&#39;,\n &#39;And says in him thy fair appearance lies&#39;,\n &#39;To side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39;A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart&#39;,\n &#39;And by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#39;The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part&#39;,\n &#39;As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part&#39;,\n &#39;And my hearts right thy inward love of heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;47&#39;,\n &#39;Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took&#39;,\n &#39;And each doth good turns now unto the other&#39;,\n &#39;When that mine eye is famished for a look&#39;,\n &#39;Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother&#39;,\n &#39;With my loves picture then my eye doth feast&#39;,\n &#39;And to the painted banquet bids my heart&#39;,\n &#39;Another time mine eye is my hearts guest&#39;,\n &#39;And in his thoughts of love doth share a part&#39;,\n &#39;So either by thy picture or my love&#39;,\n &#39;Thy self away art present still with me&#39;,\n &#39;For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move&#39;,\n &#39;And I am still with them and they with thee&#39;,\n &#39;Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#39;Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;48&#39;,\n &#39;How careful was I when I took my way&#39;,\n &#39;Each trifle under truest bars to thrust&#39;,\n &#39;That to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39;From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust&#39;,\n &#39;But thou to whom my jewels trifles are&#39;,\n &#39;Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief&#39;,\n &#39;Thou best of dearest and mine only care&#39;,\n &#39;Art left the prey of every vulgar thief&#39;,\n &#39;Thee have I not locked up in any chest&#39;,\n &#39;Save where thou art not though I feel thou art&#39;,\n &#39;Within the gentle closure of my breast&#39;,\n &#39;From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part&#39;,\n &#39;And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear&#39;,\n &#39;For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;49&#39;,\n &#39;Against that time if ever that time come&#39;,\n &#39;When I shall see thee frown on my defects&#39;,\n &#39;When as thy love hath cast his utmost
